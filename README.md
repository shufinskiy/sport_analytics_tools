<h1 align="center">Sport Analytics Tools</h1>

**Sport Analytics Tools** is a project dedicated to publishing information (code, tutorials, media) to help data scientists and sports enthusiasts work with sports data effectively.

## Motivation

- I believe that open-source solutions are superior to proprietary technologies.  
- I believe that if you've solved a problem or possess valuable knowledge, you should share it.  

## Objective

The goal of this project is to assist people interested in sports data science in tackling data analysis tasks. 

- Iâ€™ve developed **nba_data**, a repository of NBA data that can be accessed in seconds instead of hours via the NBA API.  
- I am the author of the **nba-on-court** library, which simplifies working with NBA data.  
- I am a contributor to well-known sports libraries such as **nba_api**, **hoopR**, and **worldfootballR**.  

Through this project, I aim to create a comprehensive knowledge base of tools and resources to enhance the workflow with sports data.
