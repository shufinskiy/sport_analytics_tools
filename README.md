<h1 align="center">Sport Analytics Tools</h1>

**Sport Analytics Tools** is a project dedicated to publishing information (code, tutorials, media) to help data scientists and sports enthusiasts work with sports data effectively.

## Motivation

- I believe that open-source solutions are superior to proprietary technologies.  
- I believe that if you've solved a problem or possess valuable knowledge, you should share it.  

## Objective

The goal of this project is to assist people interested in sports data science in tackling data analysis tasks. 

- I've developed **nba_data**, a repository of NBA data that can be accessed in seconds instead of hours via the NBA API.  
- I am the author of the **nba-on-court** library, which simplifies working with NBA data.  
- I am a contributor to well-known sports libraries such as **nba_api**, **hoopR**, and **worldfootballR**.  

Through this project, I aim to create a comprehensive knowledge base of tools and resources to enhance the workflow with sports data.

### 2. whoscored_light ‚öΩÔ∏è
A lightweight Python module for quickly retrieving football match event data from [WhoScored.com](https://whoscored.com) using a provided `match_id`. Supports direct export to multiple formats:
- `event`
- `spadl`
- `atomic-spadl`

#### Features
- Fast, direct event retrieval by `match_id` (no schedule/tournament setup needed)
- Outputs in multiple formats for downstream analysis
- In-memory conversion to SPADL/atomic-SPADL (no disk I/O)
- Works for matches outside major European leagues and one-off games

#### When to Use
- Quick analysis of individual matches (especially outside Big Five leagues)
- Immediate access to event data in SPADL/atomic-SPADL formats

#### Limitations
- Manual entry of `match_id` required
- Not intended for bulk downloads or production systems
